What initially started as an inside joke in my class, spiraled out of control and became a website!

## Backstory

Long story short, when people forgot to bring home and item that they brang to school, a friend of mine (Jasver, the so-called "brand ambassador") takes a picture with said item, and posts it on the class group chat.

This ended up happening very frequently, and people started calling him the brand ambassador of the school.

A week went by and it escalated to me remaking the school's website and replacing the faces on original assets with my classmates, with the main character being Jasver.
